# burger
A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM

## How it works:
1. `Eat-Da-Burger!` is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat
2. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, it will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
3. Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
4. It store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

## Library used:
1. npm express
2. npm express-handlebars
3. npm method-override
4. npm body-parser
4. npm mysql

## Also used the following:
1. css materialize
2. jquery

## Info:
- it is a MVC design pattern
- used Node and Mysql to query and route data in the app
- used Handlebars to generate HTML.
